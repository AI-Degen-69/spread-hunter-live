"""Count a run's cancels by reason, so churn and defence are separable.

`plan_orders` records why every order was cancelled and how many shares were
resting ahead of it at the time. This reads that back. Without it the record is
just two more columns nobody looks at, and the question the record exists to
answer -- "how much of our cancelling is throwing away queue position for
nothing?" -- stays unanswered.
