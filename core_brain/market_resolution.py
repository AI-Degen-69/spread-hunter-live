"""Market resolution reconciliation: when a market ends, say so in the registry.

Problem this solves
-------------------
The dashboard's QUOTING pill is a read-side derivation
(``quotes_count > 0`` from the append-only ``quotes`` ledger), so any market
the run ever quoted reads as QUOTING forever unless something writes a
terminal marker. Three terminal markers exist in the schema, but only two
were ever wired:

* ``closes.method='venue_sync'`` -- written by the LIVE ``venue_sync`` /
  account sweep. The dashboard's "Sync" button. Shadow runs never write it:
  ``shadow_sweep`` runs ``auto_manage_pairs`` (merge / single-buy-exit only)
  and nothing asks the venue whether the *market itself* ended.
* ``runtime/markets.json`` with ``days_to_resolve < 0`` -- computed by the
  ranker from the venue ``endDate``. The ranker *drops* ended markets from
  the feed entirely (its gamma query excludes ``closed`` markets), so a
  market that ended arrives here as ``days_to_resolve = None``, which the
  read side deliberately keeps (``None`` must never silently drop a market).
  Net: the feed-derived escape hatch never fires for dropped markets.
* ``resolutions`` table -- ``OrderRegistry.log_resolution`` writes it, but
  has **zero callers**. Dead code. Verified empty on every live shadow db.

So in a shadow run a baseball game that ended ~14h ago stays QUOTING in the
dashboard, because:

1. its ``quotes_count`` never decays (append-only ledger),
2. its ``days_to_resolve`` is ``None`` (dropped from the feed), and
3. the runtime-fallback funnel (used for every non-production / shadow db)
   rebuilds ``graduated`` from ``by_mkt`` *itself*, so the frontend's
   "left the funnel" FINISHED escape hatch can never fire for a quoted
   market -- it is forever "graduated".

This module closes the write-side gap. Each rotation the shadow sweep calls
``sweep_market_resolutions``: for every market the run touched that is no
longer in the current universe feed, it asks the public gamma API whether the
venue reports it closed (or its ``endDate`` passed). On confirmation it
cancels any still-resting rows for that condition id, records a
``resolutions`` row (finally wiring ``log_resolution``), and -- for shadow
stores only -- books the settlement PnL for held shares via
``book_shadow_settlement`` (method ``shadow_settlement``). ``winning_token``
is read from the venue's ``outcomePrices`` when determinable (price >= 0.99),
else kept ``None``. A failed read degrades (skips this rotation); it never
marks a market resolved on a guess.

Settlement PnL is deliberately SHADOW-ONLY. A shadow run models the wallet;
booking the redemption is what a validation report needs to measure the
strategy against real money. The LIVE loop must NOT fabricate closes -- live
redemption happens on-chain and ``venue_sync``/``reconcile`` are the authors
of truth there -- so ``sweep_market_resolutions`` defaults to
``book_settlement=False`` and only explicit shadow callers (``shadow_sweep``
and the backfill) turn it on.

The read side (``core_brain/kpi.py`` + ``dashboard/static/app.js``) consumes
the ``resolutions`` table directly: a market whose cid is in ``resolutions``
(or whose ``days_to_resolve < 0``) reads ``resolved=True`` and is excluded
from the runtime-fallback ``graduated`` list, so the dashboard's existing
FINISHED heuristic fires.
