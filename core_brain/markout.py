# THE REFERENCE PRICE, AND WHAT IT IS MEASURED AGAINST.
#
# A single mid sampled at exactly T+300s is one draw of a bouncing quantity: on
# a two-tick book the bid-ask bounce alone makes every sell look favourable and
# every buy look poor. A size-weighted VWAP over a window centred on the horizon
# is the same measurement with the bounce averaged out.
#
# The second half matters more. A raw markout says "the price moved this far
# after we filled" and attributes all of it to us -- so a market that drifted
# for reasons that have nothing to do with this bot reads as our own adverse
# selection. Our fills are overwhelmingly passive, which makes that the common
# case rather than the corner. The peer baseline is what everyone ELSE who
# printed in the same window got over the same span; the difference between our
# outcome and theirs is the part that is about our execution.
