"""Rank live venue markets by what a merged UP+DOWN pair actually earns.

The strategy buys one UP share and one DOWN share of the same binary market and
merges the pair back into $1.00 of USDC. Profit is therefore

    edge_per_pair = 1.00 - (up_price + down_price)

and the only question a scanner can answer is WHERE that number is positive and
reachable. Two measurements decide it, and they are not the same thing:

* `bid_pair` -- the two best BIDS summed. This is the price the strategy pays,
  because both legs are quoted passively. A live scan on 2026-09-06 found 50 of
  70 markets with `bid_pair` under $1.00.
* `ask_pair` -- the two best ASKS summed. This is what CROSSING would cost. The
  same scan found 0 of 25 sampled markets under $1.00 there, median $1.002.
  Crossing also makes us the taker on both legs, so the venue's
  `fee_rate * p * (1 - p)` is charged twice -- 3.5c a pair mid-book, wider than
  most of the spreads ranked here. `taker_pair_is_profitable` charges it.
  Taking a leg is a booked loss on every market that has ever been measured
  here, which is why that property exists: to keep the fact in the output
  rather than in a comment.

A live measurement on 2026-09-06 settled what `edge_per_pair` actually is. The
two books of a binary market mirror each other -- `ask_UP == 1 - bid_DOWN` --
so the arithmetic collapses:

    bid_pair = bid_UP + bid_DOWN = bid_UP + (1 - ask_UP) = 1 - spread_UP
    edge_per_pair = 1 - bid_pair = spread_UP

The pair "edge" IS the bid-ask spread, renamed. Across 32 live markets the
difference between `edge_per_pair` and the tighter leg's own spread was
0.000c in 32 of 32. A 13c pair edge is a 13c spread: a market nobody is
quoting, not money nobody has noticed.

That identity is not a coincidence, and the reason closes the question. A
binary market has ONE order book, served under two token ids. Checked
level-for-level on 12 live markets -- including books 148 levels deep -- every
UP bid (p, s) appeared as a DOWN ask (1-p, s), same price, same size, 12 of 12.
Selling UP and buying DOWN are the same order. So `dislocation` on a binary
market is not rare, it is IMPOSSIBLE: the two sides cannot come apart because
there are not two sides. It stays in the output as an integrity check -- a
non-zero reading means the venue's own book invariant broke -- not as an
opportunity finder.

Cross-market arbitrage on multi-outcome events is where separate books do
exist. Measured the same day on 8 complete events over $20k of daily volume:
sum-of-asks under $1.00 in 0 of 8, median $1.0215. A further 14 events could
not be priced at all because some outcome had no ask resting. That surface was
checked and is not open either.

What survives every measurement is this: the strategy is two-sided market
making. Profit is the spread, and it is earned only when BOTH legs fill.

Everything else in this module ranks MARKET-MAKING value, not arbitrage:
capturing `edge_per_pair` requires BOTH legs to fill at the bid, which is the
same trade as quoting two-sided and being hit on both. `queue_ahead_usd` is
therefore a COST -- money already resting at the touch that must be consumed
before our own order trades -- and a pair needs both legs, so the constraint is
the leg with MORE queue in front of it. Ranking on `edge * depth` inverts this,
rewarding exactly the markets that are hardest to get filled in.
`spread_capture_score` divides instead:

    spread_capture_score = edge_per_pair * (volume_24h / max(queue_ahead_usd, 1))

read as "cents per pair, times how many times a day the queue in front of us
clears". `volume_24h` is a coarse, backward-looking proxy for flow reaching the
touch -- the best per-market figure the public API exposes -- and it is why the
score ranks rather than predicts. It says nothing about whether both legs fill
in the same moment, which is the strategy's actual binding risk.

Read-only. This module places no orders and holds no signer; running it cannot
reach the venue's trading surface.
