"""Record a forward price tape, because the venue stops serving one backwards.

`/prices-history` returns a dense tape for a market that is still live -- 1441
points at 1-minute fidelity over a day -- and stops returning one once the
market resolves. Measured 2026-09-07: of 925 resolved markets over $15k of
volume, only 92 still served more than 30 points. That 90% loss is why the
question this module exists to answer cannot be settled from history at any
effort. The sample is capped by the venue, not by patience.

The question is whether a price move continues or comes back. Scored on real
resolutions the sample is one observation per market, which reached n=51 and
t=1.07 -- noise. The same test needs a few hundred resolved markets whose tape
survives, and the only way to have those is to record the tape while the
markets are open and stamp the resolution on afterwards.

Nothing here signs, quotes, or spends. It reads two public endpoints and
appends to its own SQLite file, which is never `data/orders.db`.

Recovery, not polling, is the design. Each pass backfills the last few hours at
1-minute fidelity and the store dedups on `(token_id, ts)`, so a pass that runs
late, runs twice, or restarts after a day of downtime loses no minutes and
stores no duplicates. A pass that cannot reach one market records the rest:
losing a market is a gap in one tape, and aborting is a gap in all of them.
