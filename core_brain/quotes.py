"""Where to rest bids. The decision layer.

THE OBJECTIVE IS SPREAD CAPTURE. Buy one UP share and one DOWN share of the same
binary market for a combined price under $1.00, then merge the pair back to
collateral, which pays exactly $1.00. The profit is the discount:

    profit per pair = 1.00 - (avg_up + avg_dn)

Measured on the paper-run database: 476 merge closes, +$1,172.35, average pair cost
$0.96006. Maker rebates over the same run accrued ~$0.22/day against $566
committed -- four hundredths of a percent. Rebates are extra; the pair discount
is the income, and it is what "spread hunter" names.

Everything below follows from that. Quote BOTH outcomes so a pair can assemble;
stay ~92% balanced so no leg rides naked; never let the pair cost reach $1.00,
because a pair bought at >= 1.00 is a booked loss on an instrument that pays
exactly $1.00; and keep quotes inside the 4.5c reward window (>= min size) so the
rebate accrues while we wait.

The universe is NOT the BTC 5-minute series. The fleet quotes the ranker's
graduated list (runtime/markets.json, via engine/market_feed.py) -- liquid sports,
esports, macro and political markets inside a 30-day horizon. `config.series_slug`
is a legacy field; see AGENTS.md.

    Selected by `cfg.objective == "rewards"` -- a stale label from the
    rebate-farming phase, kept because the literal is wired through the fleet and
    the test suite. Read it as "price from mid". The objective it serves is spread
    capture: see the module docstring.

    Rests at `mid - reward_offset` on BOTH tokens. Two properties the ask-based
    quoting never had:

      * The pair is cheap by construction -- THIS is the income. mid_up +
        mid_down ~ 1.00, so bidding `offset` under mid on each side makes the
        pair cost ~1.00 - 2*offset, and merging it returns exactly 1.00. Quoting
        off the ASK did the opposite: ~half a spread ABOVE mid on each side, i.e.
        1.00 + spread, which is why no sub-$1.00 pair ever appeared.
      * It also scores. The reward is paid on resting size sampled once a minute,
        whether or not the order is ever hit, so time in the book earns a little
        rent while the pair assembles. Small -- ~$0.22/day against $566 committed
        -- but free, and it is why sitting out is not costless. The old
        objective's gates left us out of the book 69% of the time.

    Still deliberately NOT gated on the QUOTING WINDOW. That rule exists to
    protect fill quality by refusing to open late, and here a fill is a side
    effect: the score is paid on resting size every minute the order is there,
    so a cycle spent sitting out earns nothing and buys nothing.

    The PRICE BAND and the PAIR-COST cap used to be excused on the same
    reasoning, and that reasoning was wrong -- not because sitting out is
    cheap, but because neither rule protects fill quality alone. Outside the
    band the spread has collapsed on an outcome the market already considers
    settled, so the rent is small AND the naked leg a fill creates is decided
    against us. A pair over $1.00 is not a worse fill, it is a booked loss on
    an instrument that pays exactly $1.00. Both now run in `risk.hard_block`,
    on this path. They were unreachable rather than declined: both sit in the
    legacy branch of `decide_quotes`, below the line where this function
    returns, and the telemetry reads as absent rules would -- fills averaged
    0.8152 against a nominal 0.30-0.70 band, and wta-kalinsk-kessler bought 14
    pairs at $1.0200 against a $0.995 cap.
