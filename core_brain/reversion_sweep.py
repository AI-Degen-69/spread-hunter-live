"""Replay the recorded quote tape over a grid of jump sizes and hold times.

`core_brain.reversion_watch` asks the venue one question -- fade a 3c jump,
hold fifteen minutes -- and spends half a day answering it once. The same watch
also writes every book it reads into its `quotes` table: one row per market per
minute, bid and ask, whether or not that minute produced a trade. That tape
already contains the answer to the whole grid of questions the single run was
never asked, so this module reads it back instead of waiting for new games.

Three numbers come out of every jump, and the difference between them is the
entire point:

* `fade_c` -- sell the up-move, buy it back later. What the forward test trades.
* `follow_c` -- buy the up-move, sell it later. The other side of the same jump,
  and it is charged the spread on BOTH legs. Scoring it as `-fade_c` would hand
  it the spread rather than make it pay, which turns a loser into a winner on
  paper by exactly one round trip.
* `drift_c` -- mid to mid, sign-flipped so positive always means the move
  continued. This is the signal with no execution cost at all.

`drift_c` is what decides whether anything is here. A move that continues by
less than `cost_c` -- the two crossings a taker owes -- is real and untradable
at the same time, and the verdict says `PAID_AWAY` rather than picking a side.

READ-ONLY, AND OUTSIDE THE MONEY PATH. No signer, no wallet, no order. The
store is opened `mode=ro` through the same `resolve_store_path` gate the writer
and the dashboard reader use, so `data/orders.db` is refused here too.
