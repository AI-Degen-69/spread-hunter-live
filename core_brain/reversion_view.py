"""A read-only window onto the reversion forward test, for the dashboard.

`core_brain.reversion_watch` runs for hours and answers one question of the
venue: after a jump, does an esports match-winner market come back at prices you
could actually have traded at? The recording half is a terminal program, so
between the moment it starts and the moment someone remembers to read the store
there is nothing to look at.

This module is that reading, served while the watch is still running:

* `reversion_status` -- how much has been collected: markets watched, jumps
  seen, how many are scored and how many are still waiting out their fifteen
  minutes.
* `reversion_results` -- realised cents per share, split by league and by price
  band, with the same significance bar the backward measurement was held to.

The split is the point. Dota jumps often and the jumps stick; LoL jumps often
and they come back; the 0.35-0.65 band held 82% of the measured events. A page
that pooled them would report one number that is true of nothing.

READ-ONLY, AND OUTSIDE THE MONEY PATH. Every store is opened `mode=ro`, and
`data/orders.db` is refused by name at every layer including the environment --
an operator exporting `SHL_REVERSION_DB=data/orders.db` to "see the real
numbers" is the exact mistake the refusal exists for. The production registry
has a different schema, so pointing this at it would not fail loudly, it would
report that the test found nothing.
