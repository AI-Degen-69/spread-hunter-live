"""Forward paper test: does the measured esports reversion survive REAL quotes?

Recorded history says that after a price move of 3c or more inside five minutes,
an esports match-winner market comes back over the next fifteen -- 1007 cases
across six days of League of Legends tape, 823 of them in the 0.35-0.65 band at
-2.46c. Every one of those numbers came from a HISTORY price, which is not a
price anyone could have transacted at.

This module closes that gap. At each jump it stores the quote actually on the
book -- the bid you would hit to fade an up-move, the ask you would lift to fade
a down-move -- and the opposite quote fifteen minutes later. The difference is
what the trade would really have paid, the spread already taken out of it.

**It sends nothing.** No signer is loaded, no wallet is read, no order is built.
Two public read endpoints, and its own SQLite file, which is never
`data/orders.db`: `resolve_store_path` below is the one gate every entry point
on both sides of this feature -- the writer here, and both readers in
`reversion_view` -- resolves through.

The gates match the backward measurement exactly, because a forward number
counted over different markets would not be comparable to it: match-winner
markets only, price inside 0.10-0.90 so a decided game is not traded, and a book
no wider than 1.5c. Events are TAGGED by band rather than filtered to one, so
the tails stay visible instead of being assumed away.
