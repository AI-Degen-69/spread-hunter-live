"""Where a runtime state file actually lives, during and after the run/ rename.

The state directory was renamed `run/` -> `runtime/`, three files inside it were
renamed with it, and the process keys inside the registry were renamed too. None
of that state is in git: it is on the operator's disk, written by processes that
may still be running when the new code starts.

The hazard is not cosmetic. `dashboard.server.start_bot` refuses to start a
second stack only when `get_system_status()` reports RUNNING, and that status is
read from the process registry. A registry the new code cannot find reads as
STOPPED, so START launches a second `core_brain.trader_loop --live` next to the
one already resting real bids -- two traders on one orders.db.

So readers resolve through `resolve_runtime_file`, which prefers the new path and
falls back to the pre-rename one while only that one exists. Writers keep writing
the new path unconditionally: the fallback switches itself off the moment the new
file appears, and it never resurrects the old one.

Nothing here moves, copies or deletes a file. Moving live state out from under a
running process is how you lose an append-only log on Windows; the old copy is
read and otherwise left alone.
