"""The shadow store's writers: rest, fill, and close, without a venue.

Everything here writes `data/shadow.db` through the same `OrderRegistry` the
live path uses, so the rows downstream stages read have the shape those stages
expect. What differs is where the facts come from -- a model instead of a venue
-- and the rows written HERE say so: order ids start `shadow-`, trade ids start
`shadow-`, and a merge close carries `method='shadow_merge'`.

One close in a shadow store is not written here and is not labelled: the exit
recorded by `core_brain/single_buy_saver.py` when the rehearsed pairs pass sells
a naked leg carries `method='single_buy_exit'`, the same string a live exit
carries. Labelling it would mean editing live money-path code to serve a
rehearsal. The store file is the boundary that always holds --
`data/shadow.db`, never `data/orders.db` -- and the row labels are a second
line on top of it, not a replacement for it.

`core_brain/shadow_guard.py` keeps this honest from the other side: the venue
object a shadow run holds cannot sign, and `data/orders.db` is refused as a
store before any of these functions can be reached.

        `token_id`, `amount`, `side`, `price` -- so a completion buy has no
        way to name its pair directly; this reconstructs it.

        Scoping this to "the most recent order row on this token" (the first
        version) is wrong whenever a token carries rows under more than one
        `pair_id`, which is ordinary here: `record_submit` mints a fresh
        `pair_id` every call, and a market re-quoted across rotations
        accumulates several.

        Picking the OLDEST naked pair (the version after that) is wrong for
        the opposite reason. It assumed `auto_manage_pairs` reaches the oldest
        naked pair first; it does not -- it SKIPS any pair whose last fill is
        older than `pairs_exit_window_sec`, so the oldest naked pair is

        sessions, so stale naked pairs accumulate, and every completion made
        for a fresh pair was booked to a stale one instead: the fresh pair
        read naked again next cycle and was bought again. With N stale naked
        pairs that is N+1 completion buys.

        So this reproduces `auto_manage_pairs`' own discovery rule instead: of
        the pairs actually naked on this token, keep those whose LAST FILL is
        inside the window, and take the most recent of them (`posted_ts`
        breaks a tie). An undated fill is left out, exactly as the pass leaves
        it out. When nothing qualifies the caller refuses -- loudly -- rather
        than crediting shares to a position nothing is managing.
