"""The shadow fill model: tape-confirmed volume, queue position, nothing else.

Pure by design -- values in, values out, no clock, no socket, no SQLite. That is
what makes it testable against recorded books and tape, which is the only way to
tell an over-crediting model from an honest one.

This module belongs to the rehearsal and to nothing else.
`core_brain/live_fill_engine.py` carries the opposite rule and keeps it: live, a
fill exists only when the venue says so. Inferring one there would be the worst
failure available to this system.
