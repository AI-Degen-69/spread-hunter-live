"""Shadow run: the whole loop, against the live book, spending nothing.

`python -m core_brain.shadow_run --minutes 5`

What this is for: watching the machine work. Every other way to see the full
loop -- screener through quoting through fills through the merge path -- costs
real money, because `--no-live` on `core_brain.order_manager` prints one
subcommand's intent and exits before any of it happens.

What it changes, and it is only three things:

1. **The client cannot sign.** `core_brain.shadow_guard.shadow_client` builds a
   CLOB client with no private key and no API credentials, wrapped in a
   deny-by-default proxy. Submission is not disabled by a flag; there is
   nothing loaded to sign with.
2. **The store is not the production registry.** `data/shadow.db` by default,
   and `data/orders.db` is refused outright.
3. **The run stops on a wall clock.** Driven from the injected `sleep_fn`, so
   `core_brain/trader_loop.py` needs no edit.

Everything else is the live path unchanged: the same `MakerConfig`, the same
`MAX_ORDER_USD` and `MAX_TOTAL_USD`, the same gates, the same
`decide_quotes`. A rehearsal run under a relaxed configuration would be a
rehearsal of something we do not ship.

Unauthenticated reads: books, prices and market metadata on the CLOB are
public endpoints. If one starts requiring authentication, that is a finding
to report, never a reason to load credentials into a shadow run.

The numbers a shadow run produces are rehearsal, not results.

    A shadow run exists to be watched, and before this the only thing it wrote
    to the terminal was the banner and, ten minutes later, the summary. Every
    decision went to the ring file and the store, where reading it means
    querying SQLite beside a running loop.

    Only the `quoting/decide` event logs: that is the one event per market visit
    that carries both the intent count and the rationale. Logging every phase
    would bury the decisions in rotation bookkeeping. Telemetry is unchanged --
    the wrapper calls `emit` first and adds to it, never in place of it.

    `inventory_lookup` resolves the decide event's `condition_id` to the
    `Inventory` the seam computed for that market. It has to be a lookup
    rather than shares carried on the event itself: `trader_loop.py` emits
    `quoting/decide` with only `intent_count` and `condition_id` in `extra`
    (see `evaluate_market_quote`), and that module does not change for a
    rehearsal feature. `build_shadow_seam` is the caller that has a position
    to offer -- it passes a lookup backed by the same cache
    `settling_inventory_fn` fills immediately before each decision. The
    lookup must stay total: a `condition_id` it has never seen (no lookup
    wired, or a market this seam never settled) logs the line without a
    position rather than raising or printing zeros nothing measured.

    A rehearsal names its own ring. With a `run_id`, every event goes to
    `runtime/shadow-<run_id>.jsonl` and rotation is switched off for that
    file: a 45-minute session emits ~2000 lines against the live ring's
    500-line cap, and the whole point of the rehearsal record is that its
    first minute is still on disk when the last one lands. The per-run file
    has exactly one writer, so it needs none of the live ring's rotation --
    there, many writers share one small file, which is why rotation exists.

    Without a `run_id` nothing changes: events fall through to the default
    ring with default rotation, exactly as before this existed.

    `emit` is imported per call, not at wiring time -- the same convention
    `_default_fetch_books` states below -- so what the wrapper calls is
    whatever `cycle_stream.emit` names when the event happens.

    `sweep_fn` is a no-op ONLY at this layer: this function has no `cfg`
