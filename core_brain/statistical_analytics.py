"""The statistics surface the analytics charts read, built from the registry.

The Performance & Analytics tab has five charts — position-return distribution,
pair-cost density, outcome-probability bell, post-fill markout, Monte Carlo —
and every one of them reads `kpi.statistical_analytics`. Nothing ever produced
that key: not `kpi.report`, not the TS bridge, at any commit in this repo's
history. So the charts have shown "unmeasured" since the day they were written,
including on runs that closed positions at a profit.

This builds the payload, and it builds it only from what the registry actually
holds. The rule throughout: **a section with no input is omitted, not
synthesised.** A chart saying "unmeasured" is information; a chart drawing a
smooth curve through one observation is a lie that looks like analysis.

Two consequences of that rule worth stating plainly:

* Monte Carlo needs a distribution to resample. Below `MIN_MC_SAMPLES` closes
  there is no distribution, only a number, and the fan it would draw would be
  an artefact of the bootstrap rather than a property of the strategy. It stays
  absent until the sample exists.
* Markout comes from matured horizons. An unmatured fill has no displacement
  yet, and counting it as 0 bps would report "no adverse selection" for a
  measurement that has not happened.
