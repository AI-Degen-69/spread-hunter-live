"""Live fleet loop: decide -> submit -> reconcile, reusing the risk gates.

The decision is `core_brain.quotes.decide_quotes`
-- already proven in the paper run and already wired to the live risk gates -- so
this module adds NOTHING new to the decision. Its only jobs are:

1. `plan_orders`: turn "what we want resting" into "what to cancel / submit"
   without churning an order already resting at the desired price.
2. `run`: the rotation loop that ties reconcile -> decide -> submit -> sweep
   together, and never lets one market's error stop the others.

Everything that talks to the venue (fetch market, fetch books, decide, submit,
cancel, reconcile, sweep) is injectable, so the loop's behavior is tested
without a network and the production path is wired in `main`.
