"""Live fleet loop: decide -> submit -> reconcile, reusing the risk gates.

The decision is `core_brain.quotes.decide_quotes`
-- already proven in the paper run and already wired to the live risk gates -- so
this module adds NOTHING new to the decision. Its only jobs are:

1. `plan_orders`: turn "what we want resting" into "what to cancel / submit"
   without churning an order already resting at the desired price.
2. `run`: the rotation loop that ties reconcile -> decide -> submit -> sweep
   together, and never lets one market's error stop the others.

Everything that talks to the venue (fetch market, fetch books, decide, submit,
cancel, reconcile, sweep) is injectable, so the loop's behavior is tested
without a network and the production path is wired in `main`.

    An order resting within the keep tolerance of the desired price is kept.
    Orders on tokens we no longer quote are cancelled. An intent with no kept
    order near its price is submitted.

    TWO INDEPENDENT REASONS TO KEEP AN ORDER, and the tolerance is the larger
    of them so neither can silently disable the other:

      * `price_eps`, sub-tick venue rounding jitter. A rounding difference
        below a tick is not a price change and must not churn cancel+resubmit.
      * `dead_band`, the re-quote hysteresis. Every cancel+resubmit sends the
        order to the back of the queue at a new level, and on shadow run
        run-2809a7161de1 that happened 205 times out of 205 consecutive
        re-quotes -- median move 3.0c, median order lifetime 11.7s against a
        median queue_ahead of 1058.7 shares. Not fidgeting: the mid genuinely
        walked 0.815 -> 0.285 in 30 minutes and every re-quote answered a real
        book move. Answering it still cost the whole queue position, so the
        band trades a slightly stale price for time in the queue.

    THE RE-GATE. A kept order rests at its OWN price, up to `dead_band` away
    from the price `risk.hard_block` approved. Left unchecked, the band is a
    hole through that gate: a 3c-stale bid in a moving market can carry a
    completable cost 3c worse than anything the gate ever allowed. So a kept
    order is re-tested against `risk.completable_pair_block` at its own price
    and cancelled when it no longer passes. `cfg` and `hedge_asks` (token id ->
    the OTHER token's best ask) are what that test needs; without both, the
    re-gate stands down and the band behaves as a plain tolerance.

    `hedge_held` names the tokens whose OPPOSITE leg we already own, and the
    re-gate skips them -- exactly as `quotes._decide_quotes_from_mid` skips the
    gate when `inv.avg(other) > 0`. Completion is not needed there, so the
    hedge ASK is not the price that finishes the pair, and gating on it
    cancels a valid hedge. Concretely: a kept UP bid at 0.54 against a DOWN leg
    held at 0.43 average is a 0.97 pair, but a DOWN ask of 0.50 reads as 1.04
    and would cancel and resubmit that bid every single cycle -- the churn this
    whole change exists to stop, while the naked DOWN leg stays open longer for
    it. This function has no inventory of its own, so it has to be told.

    A re-gated cancel drops the order out of the kept set, so this cycle's
    intent for that token IS submitted in its place. Cancelling without
    replacing would leave the market dark for a cycle on a price that is
    still quotable.
