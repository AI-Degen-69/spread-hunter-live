"""Quality gate: widen before exiting.

A market priced one cent too aggressively and a market full of informed flow
look identical on a single reading. Only the second stays negative after we
back off, and only the second is worth giving up the rent for -- so the
response is graduated rather than a single kill switch.

Widening keeps us inside the 4.5c reward window, which means a WIDENED market
still earns. EXITED is the only state that forfeits income, and it is reached
only after the market has been given a second full sample to recover.

    """How hard the whole fleet should be leaning on the brakes, from the pool.

    A pure function of ONE reading, with no previous posture argument, and that
    is the design rather than an omission. Everything below is a posture the
    fleet ADOPTS while a reading holds, not a sentence it serves: nothing is
    remembered, nothing is persisted, and a recovered pool lifts the halt on
    the next sweep with no re-entry rule to satisfy. Contrast `next_state`
    below, where EXITED is terminal precisely because it is a judgement about a
    market rather than a description of the moment.

    Three readings, on the same two thresholds the per-market machine uses, so
    "catastrophic" means one thing in this codebase:

      * `insufficient_sample`, or no mean at all -> NORMAL. Identical noise
        guard to `next_state`, and it matters MORE here: a per-market verdict
        gates one book, a posture gates every book at once, so acting on thin
        evidence is the more expensive mistake by the size of the fleet.
      * Past `markout_catastrophic_threshold` -> HALTED. Pooled across every
        market, a mean that deep is not one book priced a cent wrong; it is
        the whole universe selling to us on better information. Measured
        2026-08-02 the pool read -4.75c/share while every market individually
        sat at WIDENED, because none of them ever reached a sample of its own.
      * Past `markout_widen_threshold` -> WIDENED. A loss a wider quote can
        still trade its way out of, inside the 4.5c window, so the rent keeps
        coming while we back off.

    The caller decides what a posture DOES. `quotes._decide_quotes_from_mid`
    reads HALTED as "no additions to the heavy side anywhere", and deliberately
    leaves the light side, the merge and the emergency exit alone -- a brake
    that also blocked the orders which flatten a position would freeze the
    fleet at maximum exposure, which is the failure the share cap already
    produced once.

        costs real rent for no reason.
      * Leaving WIDENED for EXITED demands twice `markout_min_sample`. One
        sample got us into WIDENED; surrendering the income needs more

    Both concessions are arguments about SMALL losses, and neither survives a
    catastrophic one -- see the magnitude bypass below.
