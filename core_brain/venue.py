"""The Polymarket CLOB adapter: client construction, order caps, and venue
response plumbing.

Extracted from core_brain.order_manager so the fleet loop can cross a public seam
instead of importing live_exec's privates. Everything here is venue plumbing —
no strategy, no registry. The strategy-side decision modules and the registry
stay in their own homes.

Credential rule, inherited from live_exec: a key is read from the environment
and passed on in a single expression — never bound to a module global, never
returned, never in a log line.
