"""What the venue actually charged us, recovered from its own activity rows.

`kpi.taker_fees_paid` sums a `fee` column we wrote ourselves, so it reports what
this process believed at close time and nothing else. The venue states the fee
implicitly on every trade row: `usdcSize` is **not** `size × price`, and the
residual is the fee — added on a BUY, deducted on a SELL. One public read
recovers it, with no signer, no RPC and no receipt decoding.

That figure is the reconciling term for a venue-side PnL cross-check: the
venue's own PnL surfaces are pre-fee, a cashflow replay is post-fee, and the
gap between them should be `lifetime taker fees − maker rebates`.

Two dates matter and are not ours to assume away: fees did not exist before late
June 2026, and the taker rate stepped 0.03 → 0.05 → 0.07 afterwards. A row from
the free era recovers exactly 0.0, and no rate is ever assumed here — the
residual is measured, never modelled.
