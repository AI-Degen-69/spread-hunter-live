# Safety rails

This repository places real orders with real money. Read this before running anything.

## 1. LIVE is the default

`python -m core_brain.order_manager` reaches the venue on every subcommand. `--no-live`
gives a dry-run preview. There is no separate staging venue.

## 2. Closing commands are pre-approved

`exit`, `merge`, `redeem`, `cancel`, `cancel-market`, `cancel-all` reduce exposure. An
agent may run them without asking.

Cancelling pulls **resting** orders only. A leg that already filled is still open
exposure — that needs `complete` (supervised) then `merge`, or `exit`.

## 3. Opening commands require explicit supervision

Four things spend money:

- `quote` — rests new bids.
- `complete` — buys the missing side of a single buy. It removes risk, but it does so by
  spending, so it belongs here and not with the closing commands.
- The Trader loop (`core_brain.trader_loop --live`).
- The dashboard's **START** button, which calls `start_bot()` and launches the Trader. A
  click on the dashboard is a live order path exactly like a typed command.

Propose the command; the operator runs it. An agent runs one only when the operator says
so in that session.

## 3a. Shadow run is the one loop command an agent may run

`python -m core_brain.shadow_run --minutes N` rehearses the full loop against the live
book and is pre-approved, unlike every other loop command. The reason is structural, not
procedural: it builds its venue client with **no private key and no API credentials**,
wrapped in a deny-by-default proxy (`core_brain/shadow_guard.py`), so there is nothing
loaded with which a write could be signed. It writes only to `data/shadow.db`;
`data/orders.db` is refused outright. It stops itself on a wall-clock time box.

Two cautions:

- **Shadow numbers are rehearsal, not results.** Fills, positions and merges are modelled
  or arithmetic, never a venue execution; never quote them as performance. See below for
  what that means for each.
- The guarantee holds only for this entrypoint. If a change makes `core_brain.shadow_run`
  able to construct a signing client, it comes off the pre-approved list until reviewed.

### Watching one on the dashboard

```powershell
python -m dashboard.server --db data\shadow.db --port 8799   # terminal 1, read-only
python -m core_brain.shadow_run --minutes 10 --interval 5     # terminal 2
```

The page badges itself **SHADOW** with the store it is reading, and **START is refused**
while it does: the stack it launches always writes `data/orders.db`, so its orders would
be invisible on a page reading anything else.

What a shadow run does now is more than decide: it rests simulated orders, credits fills
from the trade tape, runs the production single-buy rescue pass, and records a merge close
per balanced pair -- all inside `data/shadow.db`, next to the decision path (scan state,
decisions logged, skip and pass reasons, the cycle stream). So the order, fill, position
and PnL panels no longer read zero during a run -- and a zero there is no longer proof that
nothing happened. Read it as what it is: the shadow store's honest state at that moment,
nothing more.

**What tells a simulated row from a real one is the store file it is in.** `data/shadow.db`
versus `data/orders.db`, and a shadow run is refused the production registry before it
constructs anything. Row-level labels are a second line on top of that, and they do not
cover every row:

- `orders.order_id` and `fills.trade_id` start `shadow-`.
- A **merge** close carries `method='shadow_merge'`.
- An **exit** close does not carry a shadow method. The pairs pass a shadow run rehearses is
  the production one, and its close is written by `core_brain/single_buy_saver.py` -- live
  money-path code -- so an exit taken during a rehearsal is labelled `single_buy_exit`,
  exactly as a live exit is. That is deliberate: relabelling it would mean editing the money
  path to serve a rehearsal. Read the store path, not the method string, when you need to
  know whether a close was real.

Three things about those numbers an operator has to hold onto:

- **The merge is arithmetic, not an on-chain transaction.** A shadow run has no key --
  `record_shadow_merges` closes a balanced pair by writing `shares * (1.00 - pair cost)` to
  the store, the same result the real merge would realize, without a wallet ever touching
  the chain.
- **Fills are modelled, not observed.** They come from tape-confirmed trade volume and
  queue position (`core_brain/shadow_fills.py`), which is the best a process with no
  resting order on the real book can do -- but it is an estimate. A fill rate out of a
  rehearsal is a model output, never a measurement of what the venue would have given.
- **A completion fills at the book's best ask.** `single_buy_saver`'s rescue pass, run
  against the shadow store, buys the missing leg at the best ask on the book at that
  moment -- the optimistic end of what a taker actually gets, not a guaranteed price.

One caveat the badge cannot fix: the cycle-stream ring (`runtime/cycle_events.jsonl`) is
one file for every process, so a shadow run's events land beside whatever a live run left
there. Each record carries the writing `pid`; that is what tells them apart.


## 4. Limits

`MAX_ORDER_USD = 25.0`, `MAX_TOTAL_USD = 100.0` are defined in `core_brain/venue.py`,
which reads them from the `max_order_usd` / `max_total_usd` fields of `MakerConfig` in
`core_brain/config.py`. Grep for the lowercase field names there; the uppercase constants
exist only in `venue.py`.

They are enforced at the call sites, not in `venue.py`: `core_brain/order_manager.py`,
`core_brain/trader_loop.py` and `core_brain/single_buy_saver.py`.

Real-money checks are allowed and are often the only real proof of a change. Keep them at
the venue minimum, inside these caps, and always pair them with the undo command.

## 5. `data/orders.db` is the registry, and the only one

Every module resolves it through `core_brain.order_registry.DEFAULT_DB_PATH`. Read it;
never rewrite or delete it.

## 6. Changes that always land with a test

Sizing, fill attribution, and the merge path. An under-counted position invites fresh
exposure on top of it; a pair assembled over $1.00 is a booked loss on an instrument that
pays exactly $1.00.
