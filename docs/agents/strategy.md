# The strategy

**Buy a complete outcome set for less than it pays, then merge it back to collateral.**

One UP share plus one DOWN share of the same binary market always redeems for exactly
$1.00. The bot screens the venue for markets whose book allows it, rests two-sided bids
*under mid* on both outcomes, waits for both legs to fill, and **merges** the assembled
pair back into $1.00 of USDC. The income is the difference:

```
profit per pair = 1.00 - (avg UP price + avg DOWN price)
```

Measured over the paper run: 476 merge closes returned **+$1,172.35** at an average pair
cost of **$0.96006** — roughly 4c per pair. That is the strategy, and it is what the name
"spread hunter" refers to.

`max_pair_cost = 0.99` is therefore the **profit condition**, not a side constraint. The
merge is the exit and the P&L event, not housekeeping.

## Maker rebates are extra, not the income

Polymarket's liquidity-reward program pays for resting size, and the bot qualifies for it.
Over the same measured run it accrued about **$0.22/day against $566 committed** — four
hundredths of a percent. Rebates are a side accrual, estimated and reported separately,
never blended into trading PnL (`config.maker_fee`, `config.rebate_rate`).

Describe this bot as a **pair-assembly arbitrage** that earns rebates while it waits.

## The universe: liquid markets inside a 30-day horizon

The **Market Filter** (`scripts/filter_markets.py`, run continuously by
`scripts/filter_loop.py`) funnels the venue — 24h volume, top-3 bid depth on both sides,
book spread, horizon — and writes the survivors to `runtime/markets.json`. The **Trader**
(`core_brain/trader_loop.py`) quotes **only** that list, via `core_brain/market_feed.py`.

- Horizon cap is **30 days** (`config.select_max_days_to_resolve`), which admits liquid
  sports, esports, macro and political markets.
- **The filter defines the universe, not a category list.** Anything that clears the
  funnel is fair game. In the measured run the survivors happened to be mostly tennis,
  baseball and esports, but that is an observation about one period's book quality, not
  a rule — do not hard-code a sport list or reject a market for its category.
- Graduated markets carry `source: "spread"` with `daily: 0.00`. They pay no rewards at
  all, and they are the markets that actually trade.
- BTC 5-minute binaries are out of scope: `config.series_slug = "btc-up-or-down-5m"` is a
  **legacy field**, read only by `core_brain/markets.py` and the `probe` latency harness.
  The 5-minute BTC series was measured dead: *"Adverse selection, not fee level, is what
  killed 5-min BTC."*

## Pricing mode: spread_capture

`config.objective` defaults to the string `"spread_capture"` (formerly `"rewards"`) and
`trader_loop._market_cfg` sets it on every market. It selects
`quotes._decide_quotes_from_mid`, which rests both legs at `mid - offset`. Because
`mid_UP + mid_DOWN ≈ 1.00`, that construction assembles the pair at `≈ 1.00 - 2*offset` —
precisely how a sub-$1.00 pair gets built.

The alternative branch (`objective="pair"`) prices off the **ask** and was measured dead:
it puts every quote half a spread *above* mid, so the pair costs `1.00 + spread` by
construction. It is unreachable in production and must stay that way.

No reward-economics knob reaches live code. `reward_min_payout_usd`,
`reward_floor_multiple`, `est_reward_pool_usd`, `rebate_rate`, `marginal_return_floor`,
`allocation_budget` and `max_market_frac` belong to the allocator in `scoring/allocate.py`
and are read by nothing in `core_brain/` or `dashboard/`. `quotes.reward_score()` formats
a log string and feeds no sizing decision.

## The two failure modes

A pair assembled **over $1.00** is a booked loss on an instrument that pays exactly $1.00.
A **one-sided fill** is a directional bet nobody decided to take. Everything in `risk.py`,
`unhedged_stop_loss.py` and `single_buy_saver.py` exists to prevent those two states.

## The completable-cost gate and the re-quote dead band

Two execution rules from shadow run `run-2809a7161de1` (209 orders, zero fills, 2026-08-25):

**Completable-cost gate** (`max_completable_pair_cost`, default `1.00`). The existing
`max_pair_cost = 0.99` checks a **both-maker** pair: `up_bid + down_bid`. On a binary
market the legs are anti-correlated (`UP + DOWN ≈ 1.00`, measured correlation −0.9989),
so a double-maker fill is rare by construction — almost every pair actually assembles as
one maker fill plus a **taker completion at the other leg's ask**. The new gate refuses a
resting bid when `price + best_ask(hedge) >= max_completable_pair_cost`. It fires only
when we hold none of the hedge token (otherwise `max_pair_cost` governs), has no opinion
when the hedge book has no ask (`book_health` already refuses unreadable books), and does
not replace `max_pair_cost` — the two bound different questions and both must hold.
Switch it off with `enforce_completable_pair_cost=false`; override the cap with env var
`HUNTER_COMPLETABLE_CAP`.

**Re-quote dead band** (`requote_dead_band`, default `0.03`). On that same run all 205
consecutive re-quotes changed price and every one reset queue position to zero (median
order lifetime 11.7 s against median 1058 shares ahead in queue). Measured suppression on
the run's own price series: 1c → 0%, 2c → 36%, **3c → 48%**, 4c → 58%, 5c → 68%. An order
resting within 3c of the desired price is kept, not cancelled and replaced; the band is
symmetric and independent of `price_eps` (sub-tick venue jitter) — the effective keep
tolerance is the larger of the two. Override with env var `HUNTER_REQUOTE_DEAD_BAND`.

A kept order rests at its own price, up to one dead band away from what the gate approved,
so it is **re-gated every cycle**: if its own resting price now fails the completable-cost
check, it is cancelled and this cycle's intent for that token is submitted in its place.
The re-gate is what makes the band safe; without it the band would be a hole punched
through the cap.

Fewer orders posted is the expected result of both rules, not a regression — wide markets
are declined rather than quoted into an empty book.
