"""Append-only cycle telemetry stream and intent logger for the live engine.

Writes a compact NDJSON ring to `live/run/cycle_events.jsonl` (max 500 lines with atomic
rotation) and logs cycle decisions to `cycle_intent` in `live.db`.

Designed for zero latency impact on the core loop:
- Fire-and-forget: never raises an exception out of `emit()`.
- O_APPEND append: one os.write per event, atomic at EOF across processes.
- Atomic rotation via tempfile + os.fsync + os.replace owned by the engine process.
