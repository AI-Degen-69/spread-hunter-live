"""Risk in dollars, not in shares.

Every per-market limit in this repo was share-denominated, and on a binary
market that is the wrong unit. The downside of one long share is the price
paid for it, so a share cap permits $72 of risk at 0.20 and $293 at 0.8152 --
it is loosest exactly where a wrong resolution costs most. Measured 2026-08-05:
three limits armed, none bound, and 85% of a -$223.32 unhedged float sat in
one market that had stopped at 233 shares against a 360-share cap.

Pure functions over an inventory and two book dictionaries, deliberately
separate from `strategy/quotes.py`. `_decide_quotes_from_mid` already carries
six caps inline; adding five more there makes the binding constraint
unreadable. Keeping them here also lets replay call the gates directly without
standing up a quoting cycle.

Nothing in here does I/O, and nothing imports the quoting layer -- `inv` is
duck-typed on `Inventory` so the dependency runs one way only.

    permits none. The largest order of a market's life therefore arrives with
    one cent of headroom left -- and on lol-maz-mg1, where 233 shares arrived
    in two fills, that is not a hypothetical shape. This walks the size down
    instead, reaching zero AT the budget rather than one order past it.

    Three terms, applied in order:

      * THE TAPER, base * (1 - u)^2 with u = `risk_utilization`. Quadratic and

        to the budget a linear rule rests 60 of a 120-share base against the
        $60 that remains, so one order could consume most of what is left.
        Quadratic rests 30.
      * THE REMAINDER CAP, (budget - naked) / price. The taper bounds the SIZE
        and not the dollars the size costs, and those differ by a factor of the
        price -- the same confusion of units that made the old share cap $72 of
        risk at 0.20 and $293 at 0.8152. With it, one order can never buy more
        exposure than the budget it is walking toward.
      * THE FLOOR at `min_quote_shares`. rewardsMinSize is 50: below it an
        order earns no score at all while still buying inventory, so the honest
        answer is 0 -- post nothing -- rather than a token order. This is what
        makes the tail of the ladder terminate instead of trickling.

    The light side is never tapered (R4). It is the only resting order that

    R6. Every other rule in this module prices a position in DOLLARS and none

    there and they point in opposite directions:

      * VARIANCE, answered with SIZE. The payout is Bernoulli, so per-share
        variance is p(1-p) -- 0.2500 at 0.50 against 0.2100 at 0.30/0.70 and
        zero at the ends. The coin flip is where a fill says least about the
        outcome. The weight `w` below is a linear taper of that hump, reaching
        zero at `coinflip_halfwidth` (0.20 = half the price band, so the
        treatment stops exactly where the band stops permitting quotes).
      * MAGNITUDE, answered with OFFSET. The downside of one long share IS the
        price paid for it, so 0.70 buys more than twice the risk of 0.30 for
        the same share. `price_risk_widen * price` demands a better price where
        a share costs more; it is monotonic in price and carries no hump,
        which is what lets the two terms be told apart at 0.68 versus 0.32.

    The coin-flip term appears in BOTH outputs on purpose. Size alone would
    leave us resting at the same price in the least readable market on the
    board; offset alone would keep full size against the widest variance. The
    offset terms share one scale (`price_risk_widen`) because `w` and `price`
    are both dimensionless 0..1 weights -- a second magnitude knob would be a
    number with no independent evidence behind it.

    Zero `coinflip_halfwidth` unsets the variance term, the same escape hatch
    every other tunable here has, and is also the one value that would divide
    by zero. The multiplier floors at 0: a negative multiplier would flip the
    sign of a size, and "quote nothing" is the correct limit of "quote less".

    """Why a NEW bid on `side` must not rest, or None if it may.

    One function rather than five inline branches, because the caller has to
    report a single reason and the operator reading it has to be able to tell
    which limit bound. `price` is the provisional resting price, read by the
    last two arms.

    Five arms, cheapest and most certain first, so the reason names the
    rejection that is hardest to argue with:

      * HEDGE SIDE (KTD2). A bid is safe only if the position it might create
        can be closed, and on a binary market it is closed by buying the OTHER
        token. A pristine own book says nothing about that: wta-kalinsk-kessler
        finished quoting 0.999 bid against a 0.001 ask, and a fill on the
        healthy leg would have left a position no price could unwind.
      * OWN SIDE. The book we would rest into, on the same three arms.
      * DOLLAR CAP. Naked cost on this side at or past `max_naked_usd`.
      * PRICE BAND (R7). Outside `price_band_low..price_band_high` the spread
        has collapsed toward one tick on an outcome the market already
        considers settled, so there is nothing to capture -- while a wrong
        resolution still costs the full $1.00. Reported AFTER the dollar cap
        on purpose: when both bind, what is already at stake is the more
        useful reading than what a new fill would be worth.
      * PAIR COST (R7). `price + inv.avg(other) >= max_pair_cost`. The pair
        pays exactly $1.00, so a pair assembled above that is a booked loss,
        not a risk.

    The last two are not new rules. Both have existed in `strategy/quotes.py`
    since the beginning and neither has ever executed: they sit in the legacy
    branch of `decide_quotes`, below the line where `_decide_quotes_from_mid`
    returns, so on the path the fleet actually runs they were unreachable.
    The telemetry reads exactly as absent rules would -- fills averaged 0.8152
    against a nominal 0.30-0.70 band, and wta-kalinsk-kessler bought 14 pairs
    at $1.0200 each against a $0.995 cap.

    R4 rides above four of the five: an order that REDUCES exposure is never
    blocked. The light side is the only resting order that flattens a
    position, so refusing it would freeze the market at maximum exposure with
    no route back down -- the failure mode the share cap actually produced,
    where it stopped the heavy side and then had no further authority. The
    emergency stop-loss and the merge path reduce exposure too; neither
    reaches this function.

    The PAIR-COST arm is the exception, and deliberately: it is not an
    exposure bound. A light-side fill that assembles the pair at/over
    `max_pair_cost` is a booked loss on an instrument that pays exactly
    $1.00, and "reduces exposure" does not make a guaranteed loss
    acceptable. It is checked before R4 returns, so the light side is exempt
    from the exposure arms only -- never from the cap that exists to stop a
    pair that cannot be profitable.
