"""Stage 3 — stop-loss / naked exit for a one-sided live pair.

This is the pairs rule already proven in the paper run, not a redesign of it.
The trigger there fired 16
times across 26,777 pairs, always on `pair_cost >= max_pair_cost`, and cost
3.67c per exit against 3.68c gained per completed pair. Those numbers are the
reason it is worth porting faithfully.

What changes in live is not the rule but the failure surface. In the paper run a
cancel always succeeds, a book read is free, and nobody else can fill our order
between two statements. Live, each of those is a place to lose money, so the
sequence is written around them:

    cancel  ->  re-read the venue  ->  sell (only if still one-sided)

**Cancel before acting, on both legs.** Selling while an order rests lets it
fill into the position we just closed. That includes the heavy leg: an order at
`partial` still has working size, and leaving it there re-opens exposure on the
token being sold. The completion path cancels too, or its own resting maker BUY
and the taker BUY it is about to send can both fill and double the leg.

**Re-read the venue between them, not the registry.** A successful cancel does
not mean the pair is still one-sided: the cancel may have raced a match that
already happened. If the other leg filled, the pair is complete and worth $1.00
at merge, and market-selling one leg converts that into a realized loss -- the
worst outcome available here.

The registry cannot answer that question. Fills reach `run/live.db` only through
`reconcile_orders` in the poll loop, so a match from seconds ago is invisible
there until the next cycle -- exactly the window this step covers. An earlier
version of this module read the registry and claimed to detect the race; it
could not. The read goes to the venue, and a failed read refuses rather than
sells.

Every refusal raises rather than returning a value that reads like success --
the same fail-closed shape `merge` uses.
