"""Capital allocation by marginal return.

`quote_shares` was a flat 120 on every market, so every market got the same
~$115 whether it returned 27.58%/day or 0.28%/day -- a 98x spread, measured
live on 2026-07-29.

Why the spread is that wide is worth stating plainly, because it is the
opposite of the intuition: income is `pot x share`, and share is
`ours / (ours + theirs)`. Pot size barely matters; competition does. Big pots
are big precisely because the venue is paying up for liquidity nobody wants to
provide cheaply, so makers crowd in. Measured, the $100 and $74 pots sat near
the BOTTOM of the return table while a $50 pot paid 27x better on identical
capital.

Nothing here does I/O. It is a pure function of measured state, so it can be
tested against the real numbers the fleet reported.

    Everything else in this module is written against `daily` -- the dollars a
    market hands out per day, split by score share. A market with
    `clobRewards: 0` has no such pot, so every function here values it at zero
    and the fleet never funds it. That is backwards for the markets U6 wants:
    bitcoin-up-or-down-* pays nothing for resting and trades ~$92k in 24 hours.
    The income is there; it arrives as spread rather than as emissions.

    So a synthetic pot is computed and handed to the same machinery:

        shares/day = volume_24h / avg_price
        pot        = shares/day x spread x capture_frac

    It is a pot in the same sense the reward pot is -- what the market pays out
    in total, of which we take our depth's share -- so `income()` and
    `marginal()` need no special case: our share still dilutes as we push size
    in, and the water-fill compares a spread market against a reward market on
    one axis.

    `capture_frac` is the honest part of the estimate, and it is a HYPOTHESIS
    rather than a measurement. A maker resting inside the touch earns at most
    half the quoted spread per round trip, and earns less in practice because
    the flow that reaches a resting order is selected against it -- which is
    the entire subject of the markout gate. 0.25 is half of that theoretical
    half-spread. The first real markout sample on one of these markets should
    replace it.

    `avg_price` is 0.5 because a binary pair costs $1 and volume is quoted in

    Two ways an allocation is dead on arrival, and plain `allocate` sees
    neither, because both depend on the market's own venue terms rather than
    on the marginal return:

      * Under `min_dollars`. `shares_for` refuses to quote below a market's
        minimum -- an order that small scores zero -- so the dollars are
        committed on paper and buy nothing at all.
      * Under `payout_floor`. Polymarket pays nothing below $1 per
        distribution, so a market projecting under it is not a small earner,
        it earns exactly zero.

    The payout floor is a REWARD rule, and it applies only to markets earning
    reward income. A market whose `source` is "spread" is paid by the taker who
    lifts its offer, in the amount of the spread, on the trade -- there is no
    distribution and therefore no minimum distribution. Applying the floor
    there would defund exactly the liquid short-dated markets U6 added it for:
    the venue never pays them a dollar a day because the venue never pays them
    anything. Markets carry `source` themselves (default "rewards", so existing
    callers are unaffected) rather than the caller passing two floors, because
    the two kinds sit in one water-fill and are judged in one pass.

    Judged AT the allocation, not at a fixed probe size, because income is
    monotone in size: Taylor Swift pays $1.00/day at its 100-share minimum and
    $5.50/day at the 600 shares the budget can afford. A probe at the minimum
    would defund a market paying 3.6x the floor.

    An under-minimum allocation is not automatically a bad market, so it is
    offered a promotion to the full lot before being dropped. The water-fill
    is a marginal-return argument and marginal return cannot see an
    indivisible lot: the two markets we face no competition in have T = 0, and
    marginal() is then a step -- the first dollar is worth the whole pot, every
    dollar after it is worth nothing -- so the fill hands them $5 and moves on.
    $5 cannot be quoted. Dropping them costs the two best returns on the board
    ($5/day each on a $100 minimum, 5%/day), so the lot gets judged on the
    AVERAGE return over the whole lot, which is what an indivisible commitment
    actually earns.

    One change per pass, promotions before drops, and the worst market first
    among drops. Dropping frees budget for the survivors and can lift a market
    that was only just under, so clearing every offender at once would defund
    markets the redistribution would have saved.
