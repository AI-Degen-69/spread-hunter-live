"""One-off backfill: mark externally-ended markets resolved in an existing DB.

The resolution sweeper (``core_brain.market_resolution.sweep_market_resolutions``)
normally runs inside a shadow session from the first rotation. Sessions started
before that wiring shipped (or a paused/restarted fleet) never ran it, so ended
markets still read QUOTING off their append-only quotes ledger. This script runs
one sweep pass against a chosen registry -- reusing the exact same sweep logic,
so the result is indistinguishable from a session that ran it itself.

Refuses the production registry (data/orders.db) exactly as a shadow run does:
it writes `resolutions` + settlement `closes`, which must never enter the real
order history.

Usage:
    python -m scripts.backfill_resolutions --db data/01_shadow_29-08_23-50.db [--run-id shadow-01]
    python -m scripts.backfill_resolutions --db data/orders.db   # refused

It reads the current map of markets only to know what to SKIP (markets still
in the universe feed are deemed still open); every candidate it acts on is
confirmed externally through the public gamma API first.
