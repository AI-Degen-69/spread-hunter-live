"""Record what the book offers and what the tape actually takes, per price level.

Read-only, and deliberately outside the money path: it opens no client that can
sign, writes its own store, and never touches `data/orders.db` or a shadow
store. It exists to answer two questions the `reward_offset` sweep could not,
because both are properties of the venue rather than of our quoting
(issue #145).

  1. **Reachability.** How much tape volume prints at each distance from mid.
     A sweep measures three offsets and spends an hour doing it; a tape
     histogram measures every offset at once, from the same minutes, with no
     arm to confound with the hour. It is also the direct measurement of
     `spread_capture_frac`, the 0.25 assumption every `est_income` figure in
     the market filter rests on.

  2. **The touch pair.** `best_bid(UP) + best_bid(DOWN)` is the cheapest pair
     two resting bids can assemble. On the current universe -- 1c tick, 1c
     spread, `mid_UP + mid_DOWN` measured at 1.0000 -- that is $0.99, exactly
     the `max_pair_cost` the risk gate refuses with `>=`. Whether it is ALWAYS
     $0.99 or merely usually decides whether the strategy has an edge to take.

Distances are recorded in TICKS, not cents. The reward window, the offset knobs
and the config defaults are all written in cents, but the book is quantised in
ticks and a level is either reachable or it is not; a cent bucket on a 1c-tick
book is a tick bucket wearing the wrong label, and on a 0.001 book it silently
merges ten distinct levels.
