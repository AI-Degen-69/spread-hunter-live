"""Measure the market FAMILIES the funnel audit left open, over a day.

The audit that produced this script scanned the global taker tape once: 725
markets traded in ten minutes, 60 of them were on the list the bot reads, and
inside the families it could not see -- Dota 2 "Game 2 Winner", CS "Map 2",
weather, five-minute crypto -- queues cleared in one to one and a half minutes.
Three of those markets cleared both the spread bar and the queue bar. Every one
of them is refused today, by the blocked-keyword arm of `identity_allowed` or
by the $125K volume gate.

That is a SNAPSHOT, and a snapshot cannot decide this. The families in question
are made of markets that open and close inside the same day: a "Game 2 Winner"
exists for the length of one game, a five-minute crypto market for five
minutes. Ten minutes of tape samples whichever handful happened to be open, at
whatever hour the audit ran, and reports the queue of that handful. The
question is whether the FAMILY is reliably quotable -- across the hours the
venue is busy and the hours it is not -- and the only instrument that answers
it is a run that samples the same families repeatedly for a day.

So this records per family, not per market. Individual markets are the sample;
the family is the unit of the finding.

READ-ONLY, AND OUTSIDE THE MONEY PATH. It opens no client that can sign, makes
only HTTP GETs against the public venue APIs, writes its own store, and refuses
`data/orders.db` by name. It cannot place, cancel, or price an order.

    python scripts/family_probe.py --hours 24            # the real run
    python scripts/family_probe.py --hours 0.05          # smoke, one cycle
    python scripts/family_probe_report.py                # read what it found

The store is append-only and every cycle is independent, so an interrupted run
resumes by being started again against the same `--db`.
