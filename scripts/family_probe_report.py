"""Read what `family_probe.py` measured and say which families are quotable.

    python scripts/family_probe_report.py                  # whole store
    python scripts/family_probe_report.py --hours 6        # last 6 hours only
    python scripts/family_probe_report.py --by-hour        # coverage by hour

Read-only. Opens the store with `mode=ro` and never writes to it.

The columns answer the three questions the snapshot could not:

  * BOOK% -- share of samples where the market had a two-sided book at all.
    A family at 0% is listed and unquotable, which is a different answer from
    a family that is absent, and the two look identical unless both columns
    are present.
  * SEEN / MKTS -- how many samples the family produced, and how many distinct
    markets they came from. A family with 200 samples from 3 markets is three
    markets watched all day, not a family that reliably has members open. Both
    numbers are needed and neither substitutes for the other.
  * Q_MED / Q_P90 -- median and 90th-percentile minutes to clear the queue on
    the worse of the two legs. The median is the typical case; the p90 is what
    a run is actually exposed to, and a family whose median is 2 minutes and
    whose p90 is 90 is not a 2-minute family.
  * PASS% -- share of samples where BOTH legs clear inside `--queue-bar` AND
    the touch pair costs under `max_pair_cost`. That conjunction is the
    strategy's entry condition; either half alone has already misled this
    project once.

GATE tells you why the bot cannot trade the family today, taken from the most
common refusal reason its samples recorded. A family that is quotable and
blocked is a config decision; a family that is quotable and merely below the
volume bar is a different one.

HOURS is coverage, not quality: the count of distinct clock hours in which the
family had at least one member open. A family present in 3 hours out of 24 is
not a day-long opportunity however good its queues look, and that distinction
is the entire reason this run exists.
