"""Re-run the Market Filter on a fixed interval, forever.

Paths are relative to this repo: the log lands in runtime/rerank.log, the cycle ring
lives in runtime/, and the filter writes runtime/markets.json for the Trader to adopt.
The scoring rules it leans on live in scoring/.

The Trader adopts runtime/markets.json every `rerank_interval_sec`, but
nothing regenerates that file -- and the U6 universe is short-dated by
construction, so every market in it resolves within a day. Left alone, the
fleet re-reads the same file until its whole universe has settled and then
quotes nothing while looking perfectly healthy.

A separate process rather than a thread inside the fleet: re-ranking scores
hundreds of books over the network, and a stall there must not stall the
trading loop. That is the same argument `fleet.py` already makes for keeping
the scoring out of the sweep.

Failures are logged and slept through, never raised. A ranker that fails at
03:00 because the venue returned a 502 must not leave the fleet with no
refresh for the rest of the night.
