"""Every grace value at once, from a single run held at the longest one.

A four-arm sweep of `single_buy_grace_sec` would split an already thin fill
count four ways and reproduce the confound the #138 sweep could not remove:
arm and hour never separated. This reads one run held at the MAXIMUM grace and
recovers every shorter value from it, because a longer grace CONTAINS the
shorter ones. If the companion leg fills 30s after the first, then grace=45 and
grace=120 both caught it and grace=15 did not — that is a filter on a recorded
distribution, not a second experiment.

Two things decide the answer and this reports both, in SHARES rather than in
legs -- an opening leg of 5 shares against a companion that only fills 1 has 4
shares exposed, and counting the whole leg "rescued" would bury them:

  * **Merged shares.** Per pair, how many opposite-side shares had arrived by
    `open_ts + grace`. `min(open_qty, arrived)` merge; the rest of the opening
    leg stays exposed. A longer grace can only raise this.
  * **The cost of waiting.** The exposed shares are dumped at the bid as it
    stood at the horizon -- a leg held 120s exits at the 120s bid, not the 15s
    one. Reporting merged shares alone would recommend an unbounded grace.

The exit side is repriced from a `book_tape_recorder` store covering the same
window, so the bid at each horizon is measured rather than modelled. The exit
total is published only when EVERY exposed pair has a bid; a partial sum is
withheld, and zero exposed shares is a measured zero. Without a book the cost
column is unmeasured rather than guessed.

The live loop exits on the first poll AFTER the grace expires, so a real exit
lands 0 to one rotation later than the horizon shown and the priced bid is a
best case. A companion that arrives within one rotation of the horizon is
flagged: the poll phase is not recorded, so its split is not resolved here.
