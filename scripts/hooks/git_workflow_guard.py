"""PreToolUse guard for the git and GitHub rules in docs/agents/git-workflow.md.

Those rules govern actions that reach GitHub: a push starts a paid review round,
a merge lands on `main`.

The agent has full autonomy over branches, commits, pushes, and merges.
This guard serves to remind on round discipline (batching fixes into one push)
and protect against runaway review loops (blocking after 3 review rounds).

Contract: reads the PreToolUse JSON payload on stdin. Exit 0 allows the command
and prints any reminder to stdout; exit 2 blocks it and prints the reason to
stderr. Anything unexpected exits 0, because a broken guard must not wedge the
repo -- every shell-out and every parse degrades to allow.

    incremental review, so four pushes cost four reviews for one round.
  * Post ONE summary comment per round: what changed, what you declined, why.
  * Triage first, then post ONE `@coderabbitai autofix` per round -- after the
    review has finished, never while one is in flight -- and read the commit it
    pushes before merging.
  * Post `@coderabbitai resolve` as a SEPARATE comment.
  * The handle is allowed in four places only: the PR title placeholder, the
    body summary line, `resolve`, and `autofix`.
  * Never post `@coderabbitai review` or `full review`. Reviews fire on their own.
"""

MERGE_RULES = f"""\
Before merging, from {DOC}:

  * Read the full diff -- `gh pr diff <n>` -- not just the checks.
  * Check what else is in the stack. A stacked merge can carry another pull
    request onto `main` with it.
  * Ensure CI is green and CodeRabbit review blockers are resolved.
  * Report concise status upon merge (e.g. `Merged PR #...`).
