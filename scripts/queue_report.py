"""Read the queue_marks a shadow run recorded and say what the queues are doing.

    python scripts/queue_report.py                     # data/shadow.db, all marks
    python scripts/queue_report.py --minutes 45        # only the last 45 minutes

Read-only. Opens the store with `mode=ro` and never writes to it.

Three columns decide whether the spread-hunter strategy has room on a market:

  * DECAY RATE -- shares per minute leaving our level, split into the part the
    tape explains (trades) and the residual (cancels). The residual is the
    number the shadow fill model cannot see: it credits queue progress only
    from trades, so on a 13,000-share queue it is blind to the mechanism most
    likely to move us up it.
  * CLEAR (trades) -- minutes to clear the queue counting trades only. This is
    what the fill model believes, and it is an upper bound on the wait.
  * CLEAR (all) -- minutes to clear counting cancels too. This is the honest
    estimate, and the gap between the two columns is exactly how wrong three
    zero-fill rehearsals have been.

A 30-45 minute read is DIRECTIONAL, not conclusive. It is enough to separate
"under an hour" from "effectively never", which is the decision that matters;
it is not enough to trust a number in the ambiguous middle.

EVERY RATE IS COMPUTED PER LEVEL, FROM DELTAS. An earlier version summed a
market's movement and divided by the wall-clock span between its first and last
retained mark. That inflated every rate twice over -- once because dropping the
undifferenced first mark left N intervals of movement over an N-1 span, and
once because it divided a combined-level rate into a single level's queue. Both
errors shortened clear times, which for a report whose only job is to say
whether a queue is joinable is the one direction that must not be wrong.

TWO MORE WAYS THIS READER MANUFACTURED PROGRESS, both fixed here and both
found by cross-checking a real 42-minute run against hand arithmetic:

  * SUMMED POSITIVES, NOT NET. Aggregating `max(0, cancel_decay)` keeps every
    downswing and discards every upswing, so a level flapping around a flat
    mean reads as pure decay. On the two tennis markets in that run the median
    cycle-to-cycle change in `level_size` was 41-59%, and the summed positives
    came to 3.4-4.0x the level's entire net drift. The collector is still right
    to record `cancel_decay` unclamped -- a negative value is real information
    about size joining the level, and clamping it there would flatter the fill
    model exactly where it is already too generous. It is the READER's
    aggregation that must be net: neither direction of clamp belongs here.
  * FAILED BOOK READS COUNTED AS EMPTIED LEVELS. `queue_ahead_at` returns 0.0
    when the price is simply absent from the book it was handed, which is
    indistinguishable from a level that genuinely emptied. That run held one
    delta of 154,132 shares to 0 with nothing on the tape explaining it. Any
    delta touching a zero-size read is dropped, and the count is REPORTED per
    market: how often a market's book fails to read is itself a data-quality
    signal, and a market whose marks are mostly drops has no verdict at all.

## How to verify

    python -m pytest -q tests/test_queue_report.py

Expected: 39 passed.

    python scripts/queue_report.py --minutes 45

Against a store with no marks yet (or one written before this telemetry
existed) it prints an explanation and exits 1. Against a live rehearsal it
prints one row per market with its median level's clear times and a
JOINABLE / ambiguous / NEVER verdict.

    A delta is the interval between two consecutive marks on the same

    would otherwise do: the first cycle of a new rehearsal differencing against
    the last cycle of an older one, hours earlier, producing a decay and a
    clear time computed across that gap.

    `dt_min` is carried on the delta rather than reconstructed later, so a
    caller can only ever divide movement by the time it actually took.

    A delta whose level reads 0.0 on EITHER side is dropped and counted, not
    kept. A zero can mean the level emptied or it can mean the book fetch did
    not return that price at all, and the two are indistinguishable from here;
    differencing against one invents a cancel the size of the whole level, and
    differencing out of one invents an equal join. Dropping does not bridge the
    gap either -- the surviving marks on both sides are NOT paired across the
    bad one, because a delta stretched over the outage would report a tidy zero
    while hiding that the window was unusable.

    `minutes` filters by the delta's END timestamp and keeps whole deltas: a
    partially-included interval would put movement over the wrong divisor,
