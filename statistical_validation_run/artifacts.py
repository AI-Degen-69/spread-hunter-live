"""Statistical validation artifact bundle (Issue #54).

Emit the machine-readable report and human memo that prove the stat gate
inclusive of ALL losses:

    reports/stat_*/report.json            full KPI dict + stat_validation block
    reports/stat_*/report.md              gate table + GO/NO-GO/INCONCLUSIVE memo
    reports/stat_*/closes.csv             every close row of the run
    reports/stat_*/fills.csv              every fill row of the run
    reports/stat_*/quotes.csv             every quote row of the run
    reports/stat_*/config_snapshot.json   effective MakerConfig
    reports/stat_*/pipeline_snapshot.json screener funnel snapshot
    reports/stat_*/markets_snapshot.json  graduated market list

The primary gate is `ci90_lower_pct > 1.0` INCLUSIVE: the 90% one-sided CI lower
bound of mean return % across every close method (merge, single-buy exit, naked
exit). A merge-only gate would be a tautology -- merged pairs always pay $1.00
for less than $1.00, so E[PnL | successful pair] > 0 can never fail and proves
nothing. The inclusive gate is the one that can fail, and that is the one the
verdict is decided on.

Nothing here reaches the venue. Everything reads the shadow SQLite store and
the effective config, and writes text files.
