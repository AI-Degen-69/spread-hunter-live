    # --- objective --------------------------------------------------------
    # "pair"    : the original bet -- rest under the ask, try to buy a hedged
    #             pair for under $1.00. Measured dead over 60 markets: quoting
    #             off the ASK puts every quote ~half a spread ABOVE mid, so the
    #             pair costs 1.00 + spread by construction. The book runs at
    #             101% all window; there is nothing to capture.
    # "rewards" : quote for the liquidity-reward score instead of for the fill.
    #             Gamma reports this series as incentivised --
    #               rewardsMaxSpread = 4.5c, rewardsMinSize = 50,
    #               feeSchedule.rebateRate = 0.2

    #               S(v, s) = ((v - s)/v)^2 * size,  v = 4.5c, s = own spread
    #             Two consequences the "pair" objective had backwards:
    #               1. Sitting out is the expensive move. The old gates skipped
    #                  69% of cycles (602/875), earning zero score for them.
    #               2. Quoting off MID rather than the ask makes the pair cost
    #                  1.00 - 2*offset, i.e. automatically under $1.00 -- the
    #                  exact thing the pair objective failed to achieve.

    # score is quadratic in closeness (0.5c -> ~16% of market score, 2c -> ~7%,
    # measured over 3906 recorded legs), but closer means more fills, and fills
    # on this book are adverse. Start back from the touch and walk in only if

    # --- inventory skew (replaces the settlement cross-hedge) --------------
    # A resting quote that fills leaves us one-sided, and a one-sided position
    # held to settlement is a coin flip on the full $1.00. The old answer was
    # to cross the spread near close, which only ever executed once the outcome
    # was already known (measured hedge prices: 0.01, 0.02) -- it booked luck
    # as profit and protected nothing.
    #
    # The answer that actually works is the standard market-maker one: skew.
    # Long UP -> quote UP further from mid (harder to fill, adds less) and
    # DOWN closer to mid (easier to fill, which FLATTENS us). It runs every
    # cycle from the first share of imbalance, while both sides still cost real
    # money, and it keeps us two-sided so the reward score is preserved.
    # The spring is wound by DOLLARS at risk, not by share count: `skew_offset`
    # scales this cap by `risk_utilization` of the naked side, so it is at full
    # stretch exactly when the dollar budget is full. A share-denominated ramp
    # (240 shares to full stretch, removed) answered a 100-share naked leg with the
    # same push at 0.85, where it is $85 of downside, as at 0.15, where it is
    # $15 -- so on lol-maz-mg1 it was still ramping at 233 of 240 shares while
    # $190.26 was already at stake and the position was fully built.

    # THE HARD CAP on directional exposure, in DOLLARS of naked cost. This is
    # the only unit the cap is stated in -- a share-denominated twin was
    # removed rather than kept alongside it, because two caps in two units
    # cannot both be the binding constraint and an operator reading "not
    # adding" would have no way to tell which one bound.
    #
    # Skew is a spring and it bottoms out AT this budget: `risk_utilization`
    # clamps at 1.0, so past the cap more exposure produces no more response.
    # Something has to own that range. The share cap that used to own it could
    # not, and the reason is the unit, not the level:
    # on a binary market the downside of one long share IS the price paid for
    # it, so 360 shares permitted $72 of risk at 0.20 and $293 at 0.8152 --
    # loosest exactly where a wrong resolution costs most.

    # Measured 2026-08-05 on lol-maz-mg1: 233.40 UP shares at an average of

    # silent while 85% of the fleet's -$223.32 unhedged float sat in that one
    # market. Three limits were armed and none of them bound.
    #
    # $120 binds between 171 shares (at 0.70) and 400 shares (at 0.30) inside
    # the price band, and would have stopped lol-maz-mg1 at roughly 147 shares
    # instead of 233. 0 disables the rule, same as every other cap here -- and
    # it disables the whole dollar system with it, because this number is the
    # denominator of all three rules that read it: the hard block, the skew
    # spring above, and U3's size ladder (`risk.size_for`), which decays resting

    # emergency. Stating the trigger in the same unit as the cap is what keeps
    # it inside the cap at every price.

    # into place: a horizon maps to its column by position, so inserting it
    # between 5m and 1h would relabel every existing mid_h1/mid_h2 reading on
    # the live DB. Because it matures BEFORE the 1h and 6h horizons while
    # sitting AFTER them in the tuple, readers that want the longest matured
    # horizon must compare durations (never columns), and the sampling loop

    #
    #   * VARIANCE peaks at the coin flip. The payout is Bernoulli, so variance
    #     per share is p(1-p): 0.2500 at 0.50 against 0.2100 at either band edge
    #     and 0 at the ends. A 0.50 fill is the one least informative about the
    #     outcome, and it is answered with SIZE -- quote less where the coin is
    #     fairest.
    #   * MAGNITUDE rises with the price. The downside of one long share IS the
    #     price paid for it, so the same share count is $30 of risk at 0.30 and
    #     $70 at 0.70 -- the same unit error that made the old share cap
    #     loosest exactly where a wrong resolution cost most. It is answered
    #     with OFFSET -- demand a better price where a share costs more.

    # 0.20 is half the width of the 0.30-0.70 band above, so the variance

    # all. The two rules then describe one geometry: inside the band the
    # response is graduated, at the edge it is nil, past the edge the band
