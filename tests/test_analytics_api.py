"""DOM and copy contracts for the analytics surface.

These replace four tests that described the pre-#94 analytics tab. Every
marker they asserted on (`analytics-hist-wrap`, `portfolioLine`, "Required
Observations", "Price Band") was gone from the page long before anything
failed, because the file was parked outside `tests/` and never ran. They were
kept skipped as a reminder of what the old panel guaranteed; #90 is the
redesign they were waiting for, so this is the replacement.

What the surface owes the Owner, and what these tests hold it to:

- The two go/no-go readings lead, and say what they mean in words.
- Nothing on the surface invents a number. Absent measurements read as
  absent -- no fabricated zero, no placeholder series.
- The squares and gates stay in human language, not field names.

Journeys under test:
1. As the Owner, Tier 1 renders the confidence verdict in plain words.
2. As the Owner, the drop-off names its worst step in plain words.
3. As the Owner, every figure on the surface comes from the payload.
4. As the Owner, the panels read as English, not as JSON keys.
