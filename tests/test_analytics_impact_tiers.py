"""The analytics surface is ordered by decision impact, not by arrival order.

Issue #90 asks for components grouped by what they decide, with Tier 1
dominating attention. The panel it replaced laid every deck out at the same
weight, so a 1,000-path Monte Carlo projection sat level with the question of
whether our average close is profitable at all.

Tier 1 is the go/no-go pair (the confidence band on the average close, and the
execution drop-off) plus the two charts that explain them. Tier 2 is
drill-down. Tier 3 is exploration -- projections and the what-if simulator --
and it renders last no matter where it sits in the document.

Journeys under test:
1. As the Owner, the go/no-go row is the first thing on the analytics surface.
2. As the Owner, every analytics deck declares which tier it belongs to.
3. As the Owner, exploration decks never outrank the decks that decide.
