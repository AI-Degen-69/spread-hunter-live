"""The Tier 1 analytics row mounts, and no sub-view can blank it.

Issue #90 asks for a smoke test that the analytics surface mounts against
mock data. This is it, and it also pins the one failure mode a sub-nav can
introduce: a view filter that hides the go/no-go pair while showing a
projection deck.

The renderers run against the stub DOM in `tests/js/analytics_surface_harness.cjs`
and the harness reports the HTML each card produced, so the assertions are on
rendered copy rather than on a call having been made.

Journeys under test:
1. As the Owner, the go/no-go row renders from a payload without throwing.
2. As the Owner, a band that includes a loss says so, in dollars.
3. As the Owner, a run with too few closes is told no band exists, not zero.
4. As the Owner, switching analytics sub-views never hides the Tier 1 row.
