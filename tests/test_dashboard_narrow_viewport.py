"""No grid on the dashboard may be wider than the screen showing it.

A CSS grid track whose minimum is a fixed length cannot shrink below it, so on
a phone the whole page grows a horizontal scrollbar and the operator has to
drag sideways to read a number. #170 fixed one instance of this on the Tier 1
row; measuring the page at a 320px viewport found the same defect one
container up, in the chart grid the Tier 1 row sits above:

    #analytics-charts-matrix   offsetWidth 296px, computed track 320.77px

The track overshoots because grid items default to `min-width: auto`, so a
chart's own minimum content width props the column open past its container.
`minmax(0, 1fr)` lets the track shrink; `minmax(min(<len>, 100%), 1fr)` does
the same for an `auto-fit` grid that wants a preferred minimum.

Journeys under test:
1. As the Owner, on a narrow screen no panel forces the page sideways.
2. As the Owner, the chart decks shrink with the viewport rather than clipping.
