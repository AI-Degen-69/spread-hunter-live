"""The decision-gates panel reads as a decision (#94).

Three things were wrong with it. The Edge Viability hypothesis printed the raw
LaTeX string `$H_1: \\mu > 0$` on screen. The renderer emitted a fourth verdict
class, `stopped` (STANDBY), that had no CSS rule behind it, so that state came
out unstyled and could not be told from neutral text. And two gates reported GO
without ever checking their own threshold — the markout gate on a single sample,
and the drawdown guard on a run that had blown straight through the envelope.

Driven through node against the real `dashboard/static/app.js`, so the verdicts
asserted here are the ones the panel would render.
