"""Dynamic caps never fall below the venue's own floor (#3).

Caps scale with the account: 25% of portfolio value per order, 90% total. On a
small account the percentage cap can land under the cost of one share, and the
venue refuses anything below `single_buy_saver.MIN_ORDER_SHARES` — so the bot
would rest nothing while believing it was correctly sized. `max_order_usd` is
floored at the venue minimum notional, bounded by the total cap so the
portfolio ceiling still wins on an account too small to fund one share.
