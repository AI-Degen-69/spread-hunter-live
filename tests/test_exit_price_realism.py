"""The rehearsal must measure the exit it would really get.

Two defects made the single-leg exit -- the most expensive path in the
strategy -- unmeasurable in a rehearsal, which is the only surface on which
it is safe to measure anything:

1. `shadow_run` pinned `single_buy_grace_sec` to 0.0 unconditionally, so the
   configured grace (45s in the operator's `.env`) never reached `_route_pair`.
   Every stranded leg was dumped on the first pass after the fill, and the knob
   could not be swept.

2. The rehearsal's market SELL echoed back the limit floor it was handed
   (`best_bid - MAX_SELL_SLIPPAGE`, a flat 2c) as though that were the fill.
   A real market SELL rests against the bid ladder and takes the top of the
   book first. Booking the floor charged every exit a 2c haircut that the
   venue never took, which is most of the "2-3c per stranded leg" the run
   reports.
