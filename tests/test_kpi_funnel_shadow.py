"""Regression: the run-id shadow db naming must be recognized as a shadow db.

The menu mints per-run shadow registries as ``NN_shadow_DD-MM_HH-mm.db``
(run-id naming). ``core_brain.kpi._is_pipeline_shadow_db`` decides whether
``report()`` sources its market funnel from the screener's ``pipeline.json``
or falls back to a near-empty runtime funnel. A prefix-only ``startswith(
"shadow_")`` check misses the ``01_shadow_...`` name, so the dashboard showed
zero screener markets despite a fully populated ``pipeline.json``.
