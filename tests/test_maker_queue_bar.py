"""The maker-queue bar: how long the queue at OUR price takes to clear.

Session B of shadow run `run-2809a7161de1` rested 344 orders across 10 markets
for 30 minutes and filled nothing. Not one order's queue drained. The existing
selection bars cannot see why:

  * `select_min_volume_24h_usd` measures market-wide 24h tape in dollars,
    across every price. A market can clear six figures a day and trade nothing
    at `mid - 2.5c`, which is the only level our maker order ever sits at.
  * `select_min_top3_depth_usd` and `book_health` measure resting size near
    mid -- which, from the maker's side, IS the queue ahead of us. They are
    floors on exactly the quantity that needs a ceiling.

Depth is good for exiting and bad for queueing, and the selector only knew the
first half. This is the other half.
