"""tests/test_market_selection_bars.py - the permanent bars the market filter gates on.

`scripts/filter_markets.py` reads these two numbers once at import and prints
them in its `--help` output, so they are what an operator sees before deciding
to run a rank. They are also duplicated: `scoring/config.py` is what the filter
reads and `core_brain/config.py` carries the same fields for the Trader, and
nothing but a test stops the two drifting apart.

The trial knobs are pinned unset on purpose. A trial is a staged loosening an
operator opts into per run; a trial value left in the committed default would
make every rank a trial without saying so.

# state which side of each bar is inside, so lowering a bar again cannot
