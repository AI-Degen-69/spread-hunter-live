"""Menu options 4, 6 and 9 survive a data/ that already holds a shadow run db.

`Get-NextShadowSeq` mints the next two-digit run id by scanning `data/` for
files named `NN_shadow_<stamp>.db` and formatting `max + 1` with the `D2`
specifier. `Measure-Object -Maximum` hands its `Maximum` back as a
`System.Double` on both Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7, and `D` is
defined for integral types only, so the format call throws:

    Error formatting a string: Format specifier was invalid.

The crash is state-dependent, which is why it read as intermittent: with an
empty `data/` the sequence never leaves the integer `1`. As soon as one run db
exists, every caller dies -- `Start-ShadowDashboard` (option 6),
`Reset-Environment -Mode "shadow"` (option 4) and
`Reset-Environment -Mode "statistical"` (option 9).

Journeys under test:
1. As the operator, a second run on a session that already produced
   `01_shadow_<stamp>.db` gets run id "02" instead of a format error.
2. As the operator, a clean checkout still starts at "01".
3. As the operator, the run id wraps back to "01" after 99.
4. As the operator, `data/01_shadow.db` (no trailing underscore) is not a run db
   and does not push the sequence forward.
