"""Option 8 (Check System Status) survives a session file with missing slots.

`Show-Status` walks the four shadow-run slots (screener, loop, observer,
watcher) and asks `Get-ProcessRecord` about each one. A session recorded
before the stop-loss watcher started has no `watcher` key, so the caller
hands `Get-ProcessRecord` a `$null` entry. With `[Parameter(Mandatory)]`
and no `[AllowNull()]`, PowerShell refuses the bind and the whole status
page dies mid-render:

    Cannot bind argument to parameter 'Entry' because it is null.

The function body already returns `$null` for a null entry, so the guard
was the parameter attribute, not the logic.

Journeys under test:
1. As the operator, a slot the session never recorded reads as "not running"
   instead of killing the status page.
2. As the operator, a slot with no pid reads as "not running".
3. As the operator, a slot naming a pid that is not on this host reads as
   "not running" rather than throwing.
