"""Recent movement is measured, and can be required, before quoting (#74).

24h volume says a market traded SOMETIME. It cannot say whether anything is
happening now: the shadow run sat 4.3 hours on a market at 0.23 with 1,777
shares ahead and zero traded, inside every existing bar the whole time, tying
up resting capital that was never going to fill.

The gate ships in RECORD-ONLY mode — `select_min_movement_usd` is 0.0, so every
scanned market carries its measured `movement_usd` and nothing is refused until
someone sets a bar from that evidence.
