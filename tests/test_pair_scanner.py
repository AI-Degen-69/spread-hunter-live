"""The pair scanner ranks live venue markets by how much a merged pair earns.

Journeys under test:
1. As the Owner, I see the profit a pair earns when BOTH legs fill at the touch,
   because that -- not the ask -- is the only price this strategy ever pays.
2. As the Owner, a market whose two best bids already sum to $1.00 or more is
   dropped, because assembling a pair there is a booked loss.
3. As the Owner, the queue resting ahead of me is reported as a cost, not as
   available size: a deep touch is money I have to wait behind, not money I get.
4. As the Owner, a pair is only called dislocated when it is cheaper than either
   leg's own spread already makes it -- because `edge_per_pair` and the leg
   spread are the same number whenever the two books mirror, and a wide pair is
   then a market nobody quotes, not money nobody noticed.
5. As the Owner, a genuine dislocation outranks any amount of spread-capture
   value, and below that the ranking prefers the queue that actually turns over.
6. As the Owner, a market the venue returned malformed is skipped rather than
   taking the whole scan down with it.
7. As the Owner, the scan records what taking both legs would have cost, so the
   maker-only nature of the strategy is visible in the output.
8. As the Owner, a venue number that is NaN or Infinity is refused at the
   boundary, because every comparison against NaN is False and one such row
   walks straight past the volume bar and then sorts above every real market.
9. As the Owner, a crossed book is refused rather than reported as a
   dislocation, because a half-stale /book response must not read as the venue
   breaking its own mirror invariant.
10. As the Owner, a mangled gamma response ends the scan with a named failure,
    not a traceback -- the same treatment a mangled book row already gets.
11. As the Owner, importing this read-only module never raises over a trial knob
    that only gates order placement.
12. As the Owner, a dislocation is confirmed by a second paired read before it is
    reported, because the two books are fetched seconds apart and a market that
    moves between the two calls fakes one.
