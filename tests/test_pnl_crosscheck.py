"""The registry's PnL, checked against the venue's own record (#123).

Every KPI number is computed from `data/orders.db`, so a systematic registry
error is invisible: every figure agrees with every other figure and all of them
are wrong. The check has to come from a path that never reads the registry —
the wallet's activity feed, replayed as cashflow.

What is tested here is mostly the refusals. A check that rounds "I could not
read that" up to "it agrees" is worse than no check.
