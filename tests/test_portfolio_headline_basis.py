"""On the live registry the headline is the wallet; on a shadow store it is not.

#97 put the whole card on ONE basis -- registry equity, `starting_capital +
total_pnl` -- because under a shadow run the simulated gain never reaches the
wallet, and a headline reading the wallet beside a chart reading the registry
gave three numbers no one could reconcile.

That reasoning is about the shadow case, and it does not carry to the live
registry, where the wallet is the answer to the question the card asks. On the
production store the page printed $169.88 while Polymarket showed $81.28 in the
same browser; even with the account-wide sync rows removed it printed $78.43,
because registry equity cannot see venue-side activity it never recorded.

So the basis follows the store: LIVE reads the venue's account value, SHADOW
keeps registry equity, and `portfolio.total_value_basis` says which was used.

The third defect here is a stale float mark. A mark was called current when it
was newer than the last CLOSE -- true of a mark from 28-08 whose positions had
been gone for nine days, because no close had been written since. The venue
re-measures the whole book on every account mark, so a float mark older than
the newest account mark describes a book the venue has already replaced.

Journeys under test:
1. As the Owner, the headline on the live page equals the balance Polymarket
   shows me in the next tab.
2. As the Owner, a shadow run still reads its own simulated equity.
3. As the Owner, an open float nobody has measured since the venue last spoke
   reads as unmeasured, not as a nine-day-old number.
