"""The reversion view is the dashboard's read-only window onto the forward test.

Journeys under test:
1. As the Owner, the page tells me how much the watch has collected, because a
   verdict read off nine trades is not yet an answer.
2. As the Owner, a store that does not exist yet renders a page that says so
   rather than an error, because the page is opened WHILE the watch runs.
3. As the Owner, leagues and price bands are reported APART, because Dota's
   jumps stick where LoL's come back and one pooled number is true of neither.
4. As the Owner, a group's verdict is decided against the same pre-registered
   bar the backward measurement was held to, so the page cannot soften it.
5. As the Owner, a store this viewer cannot read says so, because "no trades
   yet" for a file with the wrong schema is a page that lies for hours.
6. As the Owner, a fade is priced at the quote it would really have traded at,
   never at the mid the move was measured on.
7. As the Owner, the production registry is refused by name at EVERY entry
   point -- the writer and both readers -- not only at the resolver a route
   happens to call first.
8. As the Owner, a jump caught minutes before the watch ends is settled by
   the next run rather than lost, because the store is the record.
