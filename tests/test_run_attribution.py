"""Run attribution: telemetry measures THIS run, and says what config ran.

Three defects from the 2026-08-26 rehearsal (shadow-c52e533f5725), each of
which corrupted a measurement an operator then reasoned from:

  * `settle_market` observed every open order in the shared store, not just
    this run's -- six marks stamped onto a rehearsal belonged to the PREVIOUS
    rehearsal's resting orders, and a Prime verification pass reached a false
    conclusion about touch-resting from them.
  * `cycle_stream._write_cycle_intent` fell back to the process-wide run id,
    which is the LIVE lock-file id for 12 hours -- every `cycle_intent` row of
    a rehearsal was attributed to the live session (`run-5eb297de8751`, all
    200 rows).
  * Nothing recorded the effective reward_offset / price_risk_widen a
    rehearsal ran under; recovering them cost a full verification pass over
    the quotes ledger.

How to verify (operator, PowerShell):

    python -m pytest -q tests/test_run_attribution.py ; python -m pytest -q

The first command runs the attribution tests alone; the second is the full
suite, which is the bar this repo merges against.
