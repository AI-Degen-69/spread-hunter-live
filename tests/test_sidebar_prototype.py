"""The sidebar-pages layout (#95 frame, #140 content move).

The dashboard's three horizontal tabs stopped scaling: live ops, analytics,
screener and the strategy explainer are four concerns crammed into three
panels plus a separate URL. #120 shipped the frame -- the rail, five named
pages, empty containers. This is the content moving in.

It moves nodes rather than copying markup. `app.js` finds every panel it
renders into by id, and an id survives a change of parent, so `/prototype`
shows the same live data the tabbed page does with no second copy of the
markup to drift.

It is still served at `/prototype` rather than replacing `/`: this dashboard
is the control surface for a loop that places real orders, and the operator
keeps the surface they know until the layout is signed off.
