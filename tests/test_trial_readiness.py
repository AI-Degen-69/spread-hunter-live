"""Near-miss evidence becomes a trial decision (#87).

The ranker writes one line per rank to `runtime/near_misses.jsonl` (depth
rejects the allocator would have funded) and `runtime/volume_near_misses.jsonl`
(volume rejects carrying a measured volume). Nothing read them back, so the
live dashboard could show that markets were being refused but never that they
were being refused CONSISTENTLY — the precondition for loosening a bar on
purpose rather than on a hunch.

The four thresholds are the sim `?view=scan` page's, carried over unchanged so
both dashboards license a trial on the same evidence.
