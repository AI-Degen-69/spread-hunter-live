"""Taker fees recovered from the venue's own rows (#125).

`kpi.taker_fees_paid` sums a `fee` column this process wrote, so it reports what
we believed at close time and nothing else. The venue states the fee implicitly
on every trade row: `usdcSize` is not `size × price`, and the residual is the
fee — added on a BUY, deducted on a SELL.

Nothing here models a rate. Fees did not exist before late June 2026 and stepped
0.03 → 0.05 → 0.07 afterwards, so a rate assumed over old activity would invent
charges that were never made. The residual is measured instead.
