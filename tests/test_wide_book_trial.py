"""The wide-book trial knob, and the refusal that keeps it off the money path.

`HUNTER_WIDE_BOOK_TRIAL` widens `max_book_spread`, which is not a preference
but the gate that refuses a book where a fill may leave a leg that cannot be
closed. The two config modules carry independent copies of the parse and the
refusal -- the ranker loads `scoring.config`, the fleet loads
`core_brain.config` -- so both are pinned here, together, to the same
behaviour.
